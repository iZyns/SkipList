# Skiplist

Goals: Working with pointers and linked lists

I fixed some of the memory leaks but there are some that I don't know and can't fix. Some I tried to fix by deleting the node after creating them but it gives me a tcache error and some give me a segmentation fault error. I hope I coould get some partial credit for fixing some of the memory leaks. I ran out of time to fix the rest of the memory leaks.
